# C Language Programs
## Programs I have written in C.

After using Ubuntu and running Bash scripts for several months, I realized I had an insatiable fascination with everything Linux. 
Therefore, I decided to indulge this curiosity, and the next logical step in understanding GNU/Linux was to learn C programming. I am now so entrenched in this way of life--i.e. the life of programming--that I have officially recognized the blue pill as the only viable option. (Who wants the red pill anyways? Yikes.) I have fallen ever deeper into the GNU rabbit hole.
