#C Language Programs
Programs I have written in C. After using Ubuntu and running Bash scripts months, I realized I had fascination with everythin Linux. Therefore, I decided to indulge this curiosity. The next logical step in understanding GNU/Linux was to learn C programming. I have officially taken the blue pill, falling deeper into the GNU environment. Who knows, maybe the Matrix was created in GNU/Linux.
