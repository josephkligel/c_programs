# C Language Programs
Programs I have written in C.

 
After using Ubuntu and running Bash scripts for several months, I realized I had an insatiable fascination with everythin Linux. 
Therefore, I decided to indulge this curiosity. The next logical step in understanding GNU/Linux was to learn C programming. 
I am now entrinched in my learning and  have officially recognized the blue pill as viable.
I have fallen ever deeper into the GNU rabbit hole.
